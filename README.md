# credit-risk-classification
This project uses machine learning to predict the creditworthiness of loan applicants based on historical lending data. By analyzing features related to financial health, a logistic regression model was developed to classify loans as either healthy or high-risk. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The logistic regression model achieved an impressive 99% accuracy, with high precision and recall, especially in identifying high-risk loans. This model provides valuable insights to assist lenders in making informed loan approval decisions.
